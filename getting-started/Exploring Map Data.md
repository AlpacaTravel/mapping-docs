# Exploring Map Data

Mapping data contain a number of properties in order for you to stylise and
present your information. You can use this tool in order to interact with the
data and identify properties that you can use to style and present your data.

You will need:

- Your `access token`
- A resource ID, either;
  - Your `Itinerary ID` which appears as `itinerary/XXX`
  - The Dataset resource, such as `set/atdw`
