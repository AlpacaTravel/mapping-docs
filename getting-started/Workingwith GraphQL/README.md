# Working with GraphQL API

The Alpaca GraphQL API provides all the access required in order to extract out
information to display on a map.

  We recommend that you use the API only when are editing itineraries 
  interactively. You should use the GeoJSON and Vector Tiles when distributing
  content and itineraries on your website or app.
