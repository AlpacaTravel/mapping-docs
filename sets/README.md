# Hosted Datasets

To assist in development of interactive maps, Alpaca offers additional vector
tile datasets that are hosted to assign in development.

These datasets can help developers integrate regions or other tourism
information on to their maps in order to improve end-user experience.

## Australian Tourism Data Warehouse (ATDW)

The ATDW hosted tiles are a maintained data set that can provide distributors of
the ATDW a mechanism to better leverage the dataset in the form of interactive
maps.

We have regularly ongoing updates of the data to ensure that new products and
updates on the data happen frequently to keep maps up to date.

Our data sets provide access to more than 50K places, geocoded and structured
for filtering, and presentation. The data sets also assign CC0 icon sets to
quickly enhance the style of the places appearing on the map.

## Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)

The ABS data sets includes geometry such as electoral, LGA's, Postal, suburbs
and tourism regions for Australia.

## Natural Earth

The Natural Earth data set provides a rich set of broader administrative
information, such as ISO codes and timezones.
